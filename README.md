Oğuz Canbaz and Barış Adalı Dağ would like to show our project at the end of our iOS Mobile Development training. I would like to thank our instructor İsmail Hacıcaferoğlu for being there with his knowledge and support. Also, thanks to BilgeAdam Teknoloji for providing us with this training.

This is a travel application and the technologies we use while developing it are as follows:

- Developed an iOS travel application in Swift using Xcode.
- Implemented RESTful APIs to fetch data from backend servers.
- Applied the MVVM architecture for an organized and adaptable design.
- Utilized MapKit for mapping features, Alamofire for networking tasks, Kingfisher for image loading, and SnapKit for programmatic layout constraints in the application.
